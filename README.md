Aim : to classify the imagined speech of numerical digits from EEG signals by exploiting the past and future temporal characteristics of the signal using several deep learning models  
EEG signal processing : EEG signals were filtered and preprocessed using the discrete wavelet transform to remove artifacts and retrieve feature information  
Feature classification : multiple version sof multilayer bidirectional recurrent neural networks were used
